API key required, with 100 free calls available using a company email for subscription. Every accidents year dataset requires one different call (available in CSV or JSON format).\nhttps://applications.icao.int/dataservices/default.aspx\nColumns:\nDate: Date of occurrence in datetime format (time is default 00:00:00.000Z)\nStateOfOccurrence: Country of occurrence\nLocation: City or nearest city of occurrence\nModel: Aircraft type\nRegistration: Aircraft registration code\nOperator: Name of Operator (airline, institution or responsible for the aircraft operation)\nStateOfOperator: Operator’s country\nStateOfRegistry: Country of aircraft registration\nFlightPhase: Flight Phase of occurrence (take off, landing, approach, etc.)\nClass: Accident (unique value). rmk: only ‘Accident’ class was selected in this dataset (no incidens)\nFatalities: Number of fatal victims\nOver2250: If aircraft basic operational weight (empty) is greater than 2250KG\nOver5700: If aircraft basic operational weight (empty) is greater than 5700KG\nScheduledCommercial: If it was a scheduled commercial flight (airlines mostly)\nInjuryLevel: Level of injuries on person/people involved in the occurrence\nTypeDesignator: Aircraft type code (https://cfapps.icao.int/doc8643/reports/Part2-By%20Type%20Designator(Decode).pdf)\nHelicopter: if it was a helicopter\nAirplane: If it was an airplane\nEngine: Number of engines in the aircraft\nEngineType: Aircraft engine type (jet, turboprop or piston)\nOfficial: If ICAO was designated to participate in the accident investigation\nOccCats: All risk types involved in the occurrence, coded according to HRCs ( High Risks Categories codes) - ICAO\nRisk: Main risk type involved in the occurrence, coded according to HRCs(( High Risks Categories codes) - ICAO\nYear: Year of occurrence\nData Preparation\nHere are the packages I used for this data visualization:\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\ndf<-read.csv(\"data/ICAO_accidents.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\n",
