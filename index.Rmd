The proposal process is a chance for you to get feedback from me on your plans for the final project. The more information you provide me, the better feedback I can provide you. The proposal is scored on a best honest effort basis. For full credit, please include each of the following:

- Description of the data and source (must be publicly available)
- Research questions (probably 1-3)
- Some documentation that you have played with the course data (EDA)
- Preliminary ideas (even hand sketches) of different visualizations
- Identification of the intended audience for each visualization
- Note you might consider displaying the same data/relations more than once, with each plot displayed for a different audience.
- The intended message is to be communicated for each plot.
The proposal can be up to 3 pages (single-spaced), including everything.
